# cNES

NES emulator written in C.

cNES is partially derived from the now-defunct [jNES](https://github.com/caseif/jNES).

### Why?

Mostly for educational purposes, and also for fun. Don't expect much out of it.

### License

cNES is published under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Use of its code and any provided assets
